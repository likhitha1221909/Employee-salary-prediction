# Employee Salary Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit web application** designed to predict employee salaries based on key features such as gender, education level, job title, age, and years of experience. The core of the app is a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained on a publicly available salary dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/salaly-prediction-for-beginer).

Users interact with an intuitive interface where they input employee details, and the app instantly outputs a predicted salary. Categorical inputs are encoded using label encoders to make them compatible with the model.

The app is fully deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**, providing easy access through a public URL.

This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be integrated into user-friendly web apps for practical HR and recruitment analytics.
